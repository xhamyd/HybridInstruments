# Hybrid Instruments - Project Files
This repo contains a small sampling of some files used in this Hybrid Instruments research project

## File Structure:

#### board/
- `PiezoPreamp_V3.brd`: EAGLE board file for mic pre-amp circuitry
- `PiezoPreamp_V3.sch`: EAGLE schematic file for mic pre-amp circuitry
- `PiezoV3brd.png`: Picture of the EAGLE board file
- `PiezoV3pcb.jpg`: Picture of the assembled PCB circuitry
- `PiezoV3sch.png`: Picture of the EAGLE schematic file

#### img/
- `3D printed bow.jpg`: The 3D printed bow phone attachment used as a sound source
- `3D printed ektar.jpg`: The 3D printed ektar (1 string instrument) phone attachment used as a sound source
- `breadboard.jpg`: The breadboard prototype of the mic pre-amp circuitry
- `in-house PCBs.jpg`: The copper-etched boards with components soldered used for in-house testing of the mic pre-amp circuitry
- `pcb1.jpg`: The first PCB design of the mic pre-amp circuitry
- `pcb2.jpg`: The second PCB design of the mic pre-amp circuitry

#### test-patch/
To measure the success of the mic pre-amp, I made a quick test patch in MobMuPlat and Pure Data to control the gain and listen to the result of the mic pre-amp. This directory contains the two files used for this test.

#### Gain Potentiometer Graphs.pdf
During the early design process, I began testing the use of different potentiometers and their effectiveness in controlling the mic gain for the pre-amp circuitry. The results of my findings are summarized in this document.
